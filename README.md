# MOTOR-CONTROL
This repository delves into the nitty-gritty of motor control. It is inspired by that
motors are used in a wide range of both electrical and mechanical devices such as hybrid 
vehicles, power tools, drones and even robots. There are several types of motors; primarily,
the AC and DC motors. This repository will begin by showcasing the control of both brushed
and brushless DC motors using Arduino.
