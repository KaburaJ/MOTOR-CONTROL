# MOTOR-CONTROL
This repository delves into the nitty-gritty of motor control. It is inspired by that
motors are used in a wide range of both electrical and mechanical devices such as hybrid 
vehicles, power tools, drones and even robots. There are several types of motors; primarily,
the AC and DC motors. This repository will begin by showcasing the control of both brushed
and brushless DC motors using Arduino. 


## WHY?
Motors are widely used in a variety of applications in industries and in household applications globally. Learning their complexity as well as how to control them is thus essential. This project aims at showcasing the ease with which motor control can be implemented at a fundamental level. 

## Implementation

---
`Arduino` and `Proteus` softwares have been used for programming and simulation respectively.
